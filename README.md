Modification of MAS.500 Processing example. This sketch displays 2012 US Presidential Election data by state. Each state's proportion of democratic/republican/other votes are displayed in mini pie charts that pop up incrementally and are sorted according to the winning party. Meanwhile, a bar graph displays the total votes accumulated for each major party candidate.

The data was sourced from the Guardian Data Blog. Their state data seems accurate, though 
incomplete.  Their county data looked suspicious to me.  Good enough for this playground.
